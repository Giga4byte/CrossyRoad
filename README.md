# Crossy Road Game

This is a simple implementation of a Crossy Road-like game using Python and the pygame library. 
The player controls a character (represented by a red square) that needs to cross a busy road while 
avoiding moving cars (obstacles). The goal is to score points by successfully crossing the road.

#### Features
- Player Movement: Move up, down, left, and right using arrow keys.
- Moving Cars: Cars move from left to right and reset to the left once they move off the screen.
- Scoring System: Gain points by crossing the road (reaching the top).
- Collision Detection: The game ends when the player collides with a car.
- Game Over: Displays a "Game Over" screen when the player collides with a car.

- Python 3.x
- pygame library

#### Controls
Arrow Keys:
- Up: Move the player up.
- Down: Move the player down.
- Left: Move the player left.
